# cse212 Final Tutorial
## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my python tutorial over the three following subjects:
* Queues
* Linked Lists
* Trees

This training is built to help you understand basic data structures in Python. Understanding these concepts will help you to become the best developer you can and help you build more maintainable efficient code.

In this training, for each data structure, we will introduce the data structure, a real life example or layout to visualize the data structure, the use cases and efficiency, then an example of code using the data structure, and then a problem that can be solved using the newly-learned data structure.

Here is an index of the training, it's reccomended to start from the top.
