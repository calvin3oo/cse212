# Tree Time Complexity and Pros/Cons
## Time Complexity

| Operation                            | Big O Notation |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Insert/Remove item                   | O(log(n))      |
| x Contains n                         | O(log(n))      |
| Get Length (number of nodes)         | O(n)           |

This is for an AVL tree

## Pros/Cons
Pros:
* Good with searching for an item
* Good with removing an item

Cons:
* Poor with adding an item
* Difficult to work with

## Use Case Examples:
1. Needing a structure thats very easy to binary search
2. Implimenting a file structure or organizational chart that has a hierarchy easily represented by a tree
